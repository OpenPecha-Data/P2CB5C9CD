4th Imperishable: Determination.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the determination of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.

[1. To show that determination is essentially imperishable (svabhāvākṣayatādeśanārtham); and
in what the imperishability consists (yākṣayatā), it is said:]Why? Because it rests upon
all the roots of the good;whatever the bodhisattva thinks ultimately rests upon the roots
of good because of his determination.It is the determination to pass on since it is to stay
on one stage after another;;the determination to cross over since it is going to a different
state [beyond the threefold world (traidhātuka-) ];the highest determination since it
is distinguished [from the determination of disciples and isolated buddhas, as that of the
isolated buddhas is distinguished from that of the disciples];the distinguished determination
because of [gradually] grasping [superior qualities (adhikaguṅa) being] different moments
of existence;the determination having all the qualities of a Buddha clearly in view;the
determination resting upon moments of existence distinguished [from earlier stages of
development];the determination to carry through all undertakings;the persevering determination
because of indefatigability in perseverance;the determination of perfected vows because
of fulfilling the vows;the unassailable determination since one has only oneself as companion
[when realizing incomparable awakening (anuttarabodhi) ];the determination on the stage
of being well trained [like a horse] because of the absence of unruliness;the determination
on the stage of being disciplined because of nobility;the unmixed determination because
of non-contamination with the vices of untrained beings;the determination of giving gifts
hard to give because of giving even the head, the best part of the body, the determination
of morality hard to practise because of protection for the immoral, the determination
of tolerance hard to endure because of putting up with the faults of weak beings, the determination
of vigour hard to practise because of giving up the awakening of disciples and
isolated buddhas even while having it at hand, the determination of meditation hard to practise
because of not tasting meditation [which is the highest pleasure in the world], the
determination of insight hard to practise because of not deriding the accumulation of any
root of the good;the determination to carry through any practice undertaken because of completing
the duties of all beings;the determination free from conceit, pride, haughtiness,
self-conceit, self-esteem, pride of modesty and illusory pride because of discerning with
knowledge;the determination of regarding all beings as worthy of gifts because of not hoping
for recompense;the determination of fearlessness because of understanding the deep religion
of the Buddhas;the determination to go to a different state because of progressing by
means of powers [like insight (prajñā) and so on];the determination to never be fainthearted
because of helping those carrying burdens [of four kinds, that of the parts of personality
(skandhabhāra), vices (kleśabhāra), promises (pratijñābhāra) or vigour (vīryabhāra)
];the imperishable determination because of constant alertness [to maturing living beings
and the qualities of a Buddha (sattvabuddhadharmaparipākāya) ];

[2. To show that its action is imperishable (kāryākṣayatādeśanārtham), and how it is imperishable
(yathākṣayatā):]Further, determination is said to be kindness to [non-human] beings,
friendliness to living beings, thoughts for the weal of the noble, care for the not noble,
respect for the masters;protection for the unprotected, a refuge for those without refuge,
an island for the shipwrecked, an ideal for those without ideals, friendship to the friendless;straightness
to the crooked, correctness to the unruly, absence of fraud to the fraudulent,
absence of trickery to the dissemblers;gratitude to the ungrateful, thankfulness
to the harmful, help to the unhelpful, truth to the mistaken;humility to the stubborn, no
reproach to the virtuous, not proclaiming the mistakes of others, protection to those who
behave wrongly, not seeing faults in any practice of ability in skilful means, homage to
all worthy of offerings;adequate obedience to admonitions; happiness in mind at instructions
and admonitions;respecting hermits;no desire for gain, honour and fame;no regard for one’s
own body or life [in seeking true religion and doing the good for living beings];no hypocrisy
because of pure determination;no boasting because of restraint in speech;no threats
[and thus using force (balāt) ] because of contentment with what one has;responsiveness
[being freed from grasping for bad places, staying concentrated] because of no impurity of
thought;inclination towards existence because of accumulation of all roots of the good;enduring
any suffering [giving up thought-constructions (vikalpa) concerned with hard and easy]
because of concern for all beings;

[3. To show that its cause is imperishable (hetvakṣayatādeśanārtham), and that by which it is
imperishable (yair akṣayatā):] Thus the determinations of those good men are all imperishable;
all vices of existence cannot make them perish since they are supported by all merit;
since they are the nourishment of all beings; since by them one attains imperishable knowledge
[or, omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) ];

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable determination.
