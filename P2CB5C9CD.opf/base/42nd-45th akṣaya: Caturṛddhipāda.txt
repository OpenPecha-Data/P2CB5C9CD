42nd-45th Imperishable: The Four Bases of Magical Power.(p. 138)

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four bases of magical power are also imperishable.

What four? [Classification (prabheda):] 1) eagerness, 2) vigour, 3) thought, and 4) examination.

[Their cause (hetu):] The basis and place of their root is the four immeasurables of friendliness,
compassion, equanimity and joy.By practising [for the first time], cultivating [again
and again by meditation] and increasing [not interrupting meditation so as to perfect]
these immeasurables he attains fitness of thought [that is, being able to stay concentrated
(cittaîkāgryasthitibhavya) ].

[Their foundation (āśraya):] Attaining fitness of thought he reaches the first state of meditation,
and thus he reaches the second, thus the third and thus the fourth [depending on (āśritya)
the states of meditation mentioned he produces magical power (ṛddhi) ].By attaining
these states of meditation he attains lightness of body and thought [that is, swiftness
and the absence of sloth in action].

[Attaining their fruit (phalâbhinirhāra):] With lightness of body and thought he brings about
the way into supernormal knowledge [that is, the supernormal knowledge of magical power
(ṛddhyabhijñā) ].With the way into supernormal knowledge he produces magical power by eagerness,
vigour, thought or examination.

Eagerness is to be concerned with those moments of existence [the concentration of eagerness
(chandaḥsamādhi) or the qualities of a buddha (buddhadharma) ];vigour is to acquire those
moments of existence [the immeasurables (apramāṇa), meditation (dhyāna) and magical power
(ṛddhi) ];thought is reflecting [or concentrating] on the moments of existence [mentioned,
if they are there or not];examining is skill [being insight (prajñā) ] with [the characteristics
(lakṣaṇa) of] those moments of existence.

He accomplishes [magical powers (ṛddhi) ] by bringing about the bases of magical power, and
that is why they are called bases of magical power.Here he creates [magical powers] by eagerness,
fulfils them by vigour, arranges them with thought and discerns them with examining.

The bases of the bodhisattvas’ magical power stem from confidence and are unconditioned [being
spontaneously attained (anābhoga) ],they constitute lordship and the ability to go where
one pleases since it is a matter of producing one’s own thoughts [not dependent on other
causes and conditions (aparahetupratyayâpekṣa) like the practice of concentration (samādhisamādhāna),
etc., when acting],they are the proper accomplishment of all preparations,complete
establishment in the roots [of faith (śraddhā), etc., or in the immeasurables (apramāṇa)
of friendliness (maitrī), etc.],moving about anywhere [to any buddha-land (buddhakṣetra),
being present everywhere (samantagata) ],being unhindered like the wind,having the same
bounds as empty space.

Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ four imperishable bases of magical
power.
