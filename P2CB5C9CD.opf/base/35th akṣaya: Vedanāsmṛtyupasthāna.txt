35th Imperishable: Presence of Recollection Concerned with Feelings.(p. 128)

Then concerning the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration
of the feelings, how does the bodhisattva continually consider the feelings?

In these matters the bodhisattva thinks: “Any feeling whatsoever is suffering,” and by penetrating
the feelings thoroughly, penetrating them with knowledge, penetrating them with insight,
penetrating them through appeasement he experiences a pleasant feeling, but he does
not cling to the proclivity of cupidity.When affected by a painful feeling, he produces great
compassion for beings born in the places of woe, in unfortunate states of existence, and
he does not cling to the proclivity of aversion.When affected by a feeling which is neither
painful nor pleasant he experiences the feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,
but he does not cling to the proclivity of ignorance.He experiences any feeling whatsoever,
pleasant, painful or neither painful nor pleasant, through recollection accompanying the
feelings, and he cultivates the vision of knowledge concerned with being freed from all
those feelings.

He puts on spiritual armour to know fully what all beings feel:“These beings do not truly know
the way out of feelings [which is the knowledge that they are all empty], and because of
ignorance of the way out they become attached when affected by a pleasant feeling, they
feel aversion when affected by a painful feeling, and are deluded when affected by a feeling
which is neither painful nor pleasant.With feeling joined to insight and knowledge I will
teach religion so as to do away with the feelings of those beings, through skill in means
destroying all feelings, through accumulation of the roots of good attained by great compassion.”

Further, why is it called feeling?(p. 129) Feeling which is not understood [as inexistent (abhāva)
] becomes [the cause (hetu) of] suffering, feeling which is understood through knowledge
[as empty (śūnya) ] becomes [the cause of unsullied (anāsrava) ] pleasure.What then
is the state of pleasure that pertains to the feeling which is understood through knowledge?Here
there is no self, animated being, life-principle, soul, life-sustaining principle,
spirit, personality, human or man whatsoever by which the feeling arises;feeling is attachment,feeling
is appropriation,feeling is grasping,feeling is apprehension,feeling is misunderstanding,feeling
is thought-constructions,feeling is clinging to a viewpoint,feeling is
notions of [the existence (bhāva) of] the eye [being the cause (hetu) of feelings concerned
with the concept of the eye],and in the same way feeling is notions of the ear, nose, tongue,
body and mind,feeling is notions of forms,feeling is notions of sounds, smells, tastes,
tangibles and moments of existence.The pleasure, pain or state of neither pain nor pleasure
that arise from the condition of contact between eye and form is feeling,thus feeling
is the pleasant, painful or neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from the condition
of contact between ear and sound, from the condition of contact between nose and
smell, from the condition of contact between tongue and taste, from the condition of contact
between body and tangibles, or from the condition of contact between mind and moments of
existence.

Further, by way of enumeration, feeling is one, namely the experience of thoughts;feelings are
two, namely inner and outer;feelings are three, namely past experience, future experience
and present experience;feelings are four, namely the experience of the four elements;feelings
are five, namely the mental effort in the five parts of personality;feelings are six,
namely the imaginings in the six fields of sense-perception;feelings are seven, namely
the seven states of consciousness;feelings are eight, namely the eight kinds of wrong practice;feelings
are nine, namely the nine places of living beings;feelings are ten, namely [the
suffering (duḥkha) arising as fruit from the causes (hetu) which are] the ten ways of
bad action.

This is feeling in all its aspects;and, to the degree that there is perception, to such a degree
there is mental effort,to the degree that there is mental effort, to such a degree there
is fiction,to the degree that there is fiction, to such a degree there is feeling.That
is why the feelings of immeasurable numbers of beings are immeasurable [and imperishable
(akṣaya) ].

There the bodhisattva continually considering [by concentration (samādhi) and insight (prajñā)
] the feelings, produces knowledge of the feelings of all beings as they arise, remain
and disappear.

[To summarize:] Knowledge of the feelings, the good and bad feelings of all beings as they arise,
remain and disappear is called the presence of recollection which consists in the consideration
of the feelings.
