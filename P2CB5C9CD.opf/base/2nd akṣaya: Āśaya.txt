2nd Imperishable: Intention.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ intention is also imperishable. Why?

[The imperishability of intention is characterized by ten properties (lakṣaṇa), 1. the property
of purity (viśuddhalakṣaṇa):] That intention, then, is not artificial since it is not
made up [so as to hope for retribution, having a motive, it is not done for the sake of anything
else. Having no motive (ahetuka), it is the cause of imperishability in great awakening
(mahābodhyakṣayatāhetu), and thus, having that essence, it should be known as imperishable];not
made up since it is without hypocrisy [having no view to others with the intention
of cheating or deceiving them];without hypocrisy since it is right understanding [hypocrisy
and pretence arise from perverted viewpoints];right understanding since it is without
pretence;without pretence since it is pure [having subdued the habits (vāsanā) of hypocrisy
and pretence].[2. Property of penetration (praveśalakṣaṇa):] It is pure since it is straight;straight
since it is not crooked;not crooked since it is clear [in meaning which is
to be taught];clear since it is not uneven;not uneven since it is firm;[3. Property of not
turning back (avivartyalakṣaṇa):] It is firm since it is not broken [by anger when hurt];not
broken because it is stable [in practising the good of others]; stable since it is unwavering
[in promise];unwavering since it is not dependent [on material things, or even the
impermanence in the five parts of vices in the personality (kleśaskandha) ];not dependent
since it is not attached to that;[4. Property of expectation (spṛhālakṣaṇa):] It is not
attached [to material things, seeking joy transcending the world] since it is totally different;totally
different since it is irreproachable;irreproachable since it is doing good actions;doing
good actions since it is not blamed in secrecy [as inconsistent, entering both
the way to extinction and the worldly way (saṃsāranirvāṇamārgapratipanna), sometimes practising
good (kuśalacarita) and sometimes practising bad (akuśalacarita) ];not blamed in secrecy
because it is free from remorse;[5. Property of unpervertedness (aviparītalakṣaṇa):]
It is free from remorse since it is without distress;without distress since it is true,true
since it is not breaking one’s word;not breaking one’s word since it is doing what has
been promised;doing what has been promised since it is well done;well done since it is without
reprehension [in not inducing remorse in another by saying his action is bad];[6. Property
of not forgetting (amuṣitasmṛtilakṣaṇa):] It is without reprehension since it is unerring;unerring
since it is steady;steady since it is not falling back [from the incomparable
awakening];not falling back since it has regard for living beings [in making the good
of others more important than one’s own];[7. Property of purity of cause (hetuviśuddhilakṣaṇa):]
It is regard for living beings since it is rooted in great compassionṭ Tg ci 45b7-46a1

of the way to bring beings to maturity;knowing the way to bring beings to maturity
since it is not seeking self-centered pleasure;not seeking self-centered pleasure since
it is not hoping for recompense;not hoping for recompense since it is unattached to material
things;[8. Property of purity of object (ārambaṇaviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is unattached to
material things since it is confidence in religion;confidence in religion since it is regard
for weak living beings;regard for weak living beings since it is a protection;protection
since it is a refuge;a refuge since it is the principal aim; and the principal aim since
it is without vices;[9. Property of purity of mental effort (manasikāraviśuddhilakṣaṇa):]
It is without vices since it has well understood [that which things are (dharmāṇāṃ tattvam)
];having well understood since it is beyond abuse;beyond abuse since it is good intention;good
intention since it is not anything in particular;not anything in particuar since
it is completely pure;[10. Property of purity of viewpoint (dṛṣṭiviśuddhilakṣaṇa):] It is
completely pure since it is very white;very white because of inner stainlessness [in being
without the stain which is the error of imagining distinguishing marks (nimittavikalpa) of
thought (citta) ];inner stainlessness because of outer purity, [he does not give up existence
(saṃsāra) – since understanding outer moments of existence as empty (śūnya), outer moments
of existence are pure];outer purity because of complete purity in all aspects.

That intention of the bodhisattvas, reverend Śāradvatīputra, should be seen as [pure] for the
sake of getting rid of envy [in one’s own continuity of thoughts (cittasaṃtana) ], but intention
should be seen as imperishable through maturing envious beings [in having endless
numbers of envious living beings as the object (anantamātsaryasattvālambanatvāt) ];

That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of the stain of bad morality, but
intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing beings of bad morality;

That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of ill-will, harshness and hatred,
but intention should be seen as imperishable through maturing beings with hatred in their
thoughts;

That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of sloth, but intention should
be seen as imperishable through maturing slothful beings;

That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of lack of concentration, but intention
should be seen as imperishable through maturing unconcentrated beings;

That intention should be seen as for the sake of getting rid of bad insight, but intention should
be seen as imperishable through maturing beings of bad insight;

Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, [to teach purity of intention (āśayaśuddhi) as contrasted with
imperishability of intention (āśayākṣayatā) in short, it is said] that intention should
be seen as for the sake of getting rid of all bad moments of existence of all living beings,
but it should be seen as imperishable through bringing all beings to strive for the good;

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable intention.
