(p. 122) 33rd Imperishable: Accumulation of Knowledge.

What then is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of knowledge?The bodhisattva accumulates
the causes and conditions by which he reaches knowledge [beyond duality (advayajñāna)
].Which causes, which conditions?

[The causes (hetu) are:] Deep eagerness in seeking knowledge [by eagerness and exertion in writing
out and reading books, etc. (pustakalekhāpāṭhādicchanda’udyoga) ];always serving, living
with and attending spiritual friends who have attained knowledge.He relies on the knowledge
of the Buddha, not on the knowledge of the disciples and the isolated buddhas.It is
absence of conceit towards and love for those spiritual friends like love for the masters,
like love for the Teacher himself.The spiritual friends, having ascertained that the listener
has good intentions [that he will not seek religion desiring gain and honour (lābhasatkāra),
but will seek knowledge beyond duality (advayajñāna) ], bring about conversation
[teaching (1) the moments of existence to be taught (deśyadharmadeśanā), the twelvefold Word
(dvadaśâṅgapravacana) ] and speech concerned with knowledge [giving (2) teachings on the
moments of existence to be accomplished (sādhyadharmadeśanā), explaining the causes (hetu),
emptiness (śūnyatā) and so on, teachings which bring about knowledge beyond duality (advayajñāna)
],knowing he is a worthy recipient they unceasingly teach religion which is not
concerned with outer things [like the manuals of the outsiders (bāhyakaśāstravyākaraṇa),
but giving (3) teachings on the moments of existence to be attained (anugantavyadharmadeśanā),
thus always teaching the moments of existence which are the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣyadharma)
].

[The conditions (pratyaya) are:] Having heard these religious teachings [of the above-mentioned
three kinds, being causes (hetu), from spiritual friends] he [the person seeking religion]
makes an effort to accumulate religious teachings, and the effort to accumulate religious
teachings is his accumulation of knowledge.What then is the effort to accumulate religious
teachings?

[1. Undertakings being causes of knowledge (hetvārambha):] Having few things for the benefit
of oneself;doing few [worldly] things [like commerce and agriculture];being moderate in speech;having
few necessities of life;making an effort at practising vigilance in the beginning
and end of the night;reflecting on the meaning of what one has heard;seeking it more
and more;no confusion in thought;suppression of hindrances;knowing the way out of the sinful;no
remorse;no manifestation of vices;firmness in realization [not being content with the
words only, but striving to accomplish the religious teachings as they have been heard];inclination
towards religion [in grasping the words (vākya) of the teaching explained at the
time of hearing (śrutakāla) ];proneness to religion [finding the meaning in the teachings
heard (śrutadharmârtha) at the time of pondering (cintākāla) ];propensity to religion [in
approaching the fruit (phala) by repeated meditation (bhāvanā) on the meaning found by
pondering (cintā) ],perfection in courage [not being overcome by the contraries of vices,
etc. (kleśâdivipakṣa) ];being like one whose head and clothes are on fire in seeking knowledge;but
not attached to any of these [things in the way of not apprehending (anupalambha)
them, not being attached to material things (āmiṣa) ];no loose morality;never putting the
burden down;gaining distinction [in growing];avoiding crowds;finding joy in solitude;having
the mind bent on solitude in the woods;content with the family of the holy;never unstable
with regard to the qualities of purification;joy consisting in pleasure in the joy of religion;forgetting
worldly incantations;seeking the supramundane moments of existence;unwavering
recollection;being in accordance with understanding the meaning [in thinking in accordance
with the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) ];being in accordance with
the way through intelligence;keeping vows with steadfastness;accordance with knowledge
by conditions [that is, knowledge in accordance with the principle of dependent origination
(pratītyasamutpāda), or, accumulating the causes of knowledge beyond duality (advayajñānahetu)
by knowing the essential character of the moments of existence which is dependent origination
(dharmāṇāṃ pratītyasamutpādalakṣaṇajñānena) ];being adorned with shame and modesty
[and thus doing no sin through having regard for oneself and others].[2. Undertakings
concerned with the essence of knowledge (svabhāvârambha):] Making it the most important thing
to be in accordance with knowledge [seeking it in any practice whatsoever];suppressing
ignorance;purification of the eye of insight for those tied down by the darkness and blindness
of ignorance and delusion;purity in understanding [no hindrances concerning things to
be known or vices];broadness in understanding [having the Great Way in scope (mahāyānâlambanatayā)
];no narrowness in understanding [siding with the small way (hīnayāna) ];no divided
understanding [no attachment to various kinds of viewpoints (dṛṣṭi) ];illuminated understanding
[because of original purity (prakṛtiviśuddhi) ];immediate knowledge [unhindered
in the three times].

[3. Undertakings which are fruits of knowledge (phalārambha):] Not to depend on the qualities
of others [but obtaining good qualities oneself],no haughtiness because of one’s own qualities
[having really obtained them];and praising the qualities of others [having no envy
(īrṣyā) ] (p. 123);doing good actions;never freeing oneself from the burden of maturing one’s
actions [even though understanding the state of emptiness (śūnyatādharma), he accepts
the maturation of actions];knowledge of the purification of actions. [These are the conditions
(pratyaya) ].

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of knowledge.

Further, the accumulation of knowledge is of four kinds [that is, the causes producing knowledge
(jñānotpādahetu) are of four kinds]. What four?

These four gifts augment the accumulation of knowledge. What four?The gift of birch-bark for
writing, ink and books to the preachers of religion;different kinds of teaching thrones to
the preachers of religion;giving all gain, honour and praise to the preachers of religion;giving
compliments without guile to the preachers of religion to grasp religion [oneself].Those
four gifts augment the accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of protection augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Protecting
the preachers of religion like protecting a lord [or protecting them for fear
of kings (rājabhaya) ];protecting [their] roots of good;protecting [the preachers of religion
when they travel in] kingdoms and among peoples;protecting the beneficial things.Those
four augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of support augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Supporting
the preachers of religion with material things;supporting them because of religion
[to prolong the existence of true religion (saddharmacirasthitikatā) ];supporting them
because of insight [so that their insight is not lost];supporting them because of knowledge
[so that their knowledge grows and is not lost].Those four augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation
of knowledge.

These five powers augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What five?The power of
faith for confidence;the power of vigour for seeking learning;the power of recollection
so as not to forget the thought of awakening;the power of concentration to have thoughts always
reflecting on universal sameness;the power of insight for the sake of power of learning
[so as to understand the teachings (dharma) ].Those five powers augment the bodhisattvas’
accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of morality augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?The
morality of joy in religion;the morality of seeking religion [through spiritual friends,
listening to their teachings, writing and reading them];the morality of reflecting on religion
[with logic (yukti) ];the morality of transforming into awakening.Those four kinds
of morality augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of tolerance augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Tolerating
bad speech [which enumerates bad qualities (doṣa) behind one’s back (parokṣāt)
] and abusive speech [uttered to one’s face (sākṣāt) ] through striving to seek religion;tolerating
wind, sun, cold, heat, thirst and hunger through striving to seek religion;tolerance
in accordance with teachers and preceptors [enduring pain to act according to their
instructions] through striving to seek religion;tolerance of moments of existence as being
emptiness, beyond distinguishing marks and beyond longing, through striving to seek religion.Those
four kinds of tolerance augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

(p. 124) These four kinds of vigour augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What
four?The vigour to hear [many books (grantha) ];the vigour to retain in mind [their meaning
(artha) ];the vigour to teach [others the teachings one has heard and grasped];the vigour
to progress spiritually [cultivating by meditation the teachings].Those four kinds of
vigour augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four limbs of meditation augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Staying
[bodily] in solitude;one-pointedness [of thought];seeking supernormal knowledge
in meditation;relying on the Buddhas’ knowledge [not that of disciples and isolated buddhas].Those
four limbs of meditation augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four lights of insight augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?Not
behaving according to the view of annihilation;not entering into the view of eternity;not
being in contradiction with dependent origination;tolerating absence of a self [without
fear].Those four lights of insight augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of expedient means augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What
four?Accordance with the world;accordance with religion;accordance with living beings;accordance
with knowledge [of omniscience].Those four kinds of expedient means augment the bodhisattvas’
accumulation of knowledge.

These four ways augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge. What four?The way of the
perfections;the way of the stages;the way of the wings of awakening;the way to knowledge
of omniscience.Those four ways augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

These four kinds of never having enough augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.
What four?Never having enough of learning;never having enough of teaching;never having enough
of examining things;never having enough of knowledge.Those four kinds of never having
enough augment the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of knowledge.

Further, the accumulation of knowledge is to be in accordance with all living beings [not forsaking
existence (saṃsāra) so as to work the weal of living beings (sattvārtha) with the
form of great compassion (mahākaruṇārūpeṇa) ], but also to be in accordance with all religious
things [even though in this way not forsaking existence (saṃsāra), not being in opposition
to extinction (nirvāṇa), not forgetting extinction, in short, teaching the extinction
which is found nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ].

The accumulation of knowledge should be seen as arising from generosity, and in the same way
the accumulation of knowledge should be seen also as arising from morality, tolerance, vigour,
meditation and insight;the accumulation of knowledge should be seen as arising from
friendliness, compassion, joy and equanimity.

Why [do the above-mentioned things (dharma) become the accumulation of knowledge]?All the bodhisattvas’
undertakings [mentioned supra by name (nāmagrāhika) p. 122,18-123,4 and divided
into 1) undertakings which are causes of knowledge (hetvārambha), 2) undertakings concerned
with the essence of knowledge (svabhāvârambha) and 3) undertakings which are fruits of
knowledge (phalārambha) ] originate through knowledge because they are preceded by knowledge
[making knowledge the most important (jñānapara) ], because they rely on knowledge, and
depend on knowledge of omniscience [by way of having it as the object (ālambana) ].It [the
accumulation of knowledge] is the support of all who know,in it none of the Evil Ones will
find a weak spot,here all the worthy receptacles of the Buddhas’ religion are present,
and they attain the blessing of the Buddhas, they attain omniscience [being furnished with
the causes (hetu) that bring omniscience about].

This is the imperishability of knowledge’s accumulation.(p. 125) These, reverend Śāradvatīputra,
are called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable accumulation of merit and knowledge.
