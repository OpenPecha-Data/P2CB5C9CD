12th Imperishable: Compassion.(p. 87)

[1. The highest of all the Buddha’s qualities (agrabhūtā sarvabuddhadharmāṇām):] Further, reverend
Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ great compassion is also imperishable. Why? Because
it is a prerequisite.

As, reverend Śāradvatīputra, breathing in and (p. 88) out is a prerequisite to the power of
life in man, just so, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is great compassion a prerequisite to the bodhisattva’s
accomplishment of the great way.

As the precious wheel of power belonging to the universal king is a prerequisite to the seven
kinds of wealth, just so great compassion is a prerequisite to the bodhisattva’s accomplishment
of the knowledge of omniscience.

As a rich man or householder has heartfelt love for his only virtuous son, just so the bodhisattva
with great compassion has heartfelt love for all beings.

[2. Etymology (nirukti):] As for this great compassion, reverend Śāradvatīputra, [the meaning
of the word compassion is “work” (tasyāḥ karuṇāyāḥ śabdārthaḥ karaṇeti), and all roots of
the good are] work performed by oneself, thus it is called great compassion;[even if it
is for the sake of both others and oneself] it is one’s own work, thus it is called great
compassion;it is the absence of authority over others [setting them to work], thus it is called
great compassion.

[4. Its action (karman):] Thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, any liberation whatsoever [from vices,
from the threefold world] of the bodhisattva originates from great compassion [thus compassion
produces (evaṃ karuṇôtpādayati), and, since it is something that effects action (yasmāt
kāryakāraṇam) ], that is why it is called great compassion.[What then does it effect
(kiṃ kārayati)?] Thus great compassion is what effects generosity, effects morality, effects
tolerance, effects vigour, effects meditation, effects insight, effects expedient means,
effects all moments of existence that are wings of awakening.Great compassion is what
effects the accomplishment of self-existent knowledge, effects good deeds, effects absence
of regret, effects the necessary.It has its origin in being engaged in whatever action is
necessary for all beings, thus it is called great compassion.

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ great compassion.
