79th Imperishable: The Way Traversed Alone.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ way traversed alone is also imperishable.

What then is the way traversed alone?

On the way traversed alone the bodhisattvas are not dependent on any other.The way traversed
alone [which is the one way (ekayāna), is as follows]:alone, without a second, without a
companion, the bodhisattva puts on armour [producing the thought of incomparable awakening
he acts with vigour (vīrya) ] for the sake of incomparable complete awakening.With determination
in which his own vigour, strength and power are included, beyond situations created
by others, autonomous, he distinguishes himself in power by his own power, thus he is armoured
in strong armour:“Whatever living beings will attain, that I will attain;what all the
holy ones and all the bodhisattvas who have recently entered the way will attain, that
I will attain.

Generosity is not my companion, I am rather the companion of generosity;morality, tolerance,
vigour, meditation and insight are not my companions, I am rather the companion of morality,
tolerance, vigour, meditation and insight;

I am not to be served by the perfections, the perfections are rather to be served by me.I am
not to be served by the means of attraction, the means of attraction are rather to be served
by me;I am not to be served by all the good moments of existence, all the good moments
of existence are rather to be served by me.

By the said moments of existence I will wake up to the incomparable complete awakening by insight
[which is knowledge free of thought-construction (nirvikalpajñāna) ] connected to the
moment of thought [when reaching awakening], without a companion, autonomous, beyond situations
created by others, alone, without a second, established without a companion on the
adamantine place on earth, having subdued the Evil One with his forces and army.Thus he wakes
up.

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable way traversed alone.
