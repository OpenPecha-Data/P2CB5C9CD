72nd Imperishable: Expanded Vision.

What then is the imperishability of expanded vision?

It is the way of cultivation connected to insight [since expanded vision is the essence of insight
(prajñāsvabhāva), it is all practice (abhyāsa) directed towards insight];knowledge
of the immovability of moments of existence;[as there is no mover (kāraka), thus it is] knowledge
of selflessness, no being, no life-principle, no life-supporting principle, no personality;knowledge
seeing the parts of personality as an illusion;knowledge seeing the spheres
of sense-perception as snake-poison;knowledge seeing the fields of sense-perception as
an empty village;knowledge seeing the [four holy] truths as well understood;knowledge seeing
things not in contradiction to dependent origination [that is, seeing all moments of
existence as arising from causes and conditions (sarvadharmāṇāṃ hetupratyayôtpādadarśanam)
];knowledge seeing that which is beyond any viewpoint;knowledge seeing that the maturation
of the fruit from its cause will never cease [as one performs action, one will accordingly
experience its maturation];knowledge seeing through inspection the realization of the attainment
of the fruit [of accumulating merit and knowledge (puṇyajñānasaṃbhāra), namely the
extinction which is found nowhere (apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa) ];knowledge seeing the attainment
of truth [namely emptiness (śūnyatā) ] is expanded vision.

[Further] expanded vision is truly seeing the moments of existence,seeing the moments of existence
as they are,seeing the essence of moments of existence,seeing that the moments of existence
are as they are and not otherwise,seeing that the moments of existence are empty,
without distinguishing marks and nothing to be longed for,seeing that the moments of existence
are unconditioned, unborn, unoriginated, inexistent, just as they are, pure [in being
originally brilliant (prakṛtiprabhāsvarāḥ) ] and separated [from and thus empty of the forms
of subject and object (grāhyagrāhâkāraiḥ śūnyāḥ) ],seeing that the moments of existence
are without [absolute] movement, without a mover, without an owner, not possible to own,
undifferentiated, of one taste, having the essence of space, originally extinguished.

[Further] as for expanded vision,he does not see any form [existent own-being (svabhāva) or
really existent state (bhāva) ] of existence,does not see any form [own-being (svabhāva) or
really existent state (bhāva) ] of non-existence;does not see any form of originating, remaining
and disappearing;does not see any form [or own-being (svabhāva) ] of objects [like
form, sound, etc. (rūpaśabdâdi) ] nor of distinguishing marks [like white, red, etc. (śuklalohitādi)
].Though seeing he sees nothing,he sees when there is no seeing;(p. 148) by expanded
vision he sees neither seeing nor non-seeing.When there is such seeing he sees truth,
and by seeing the truth he attains skill in expanded vision [that is, skill with the essential
characteristic (lakṣaṇa) of moments of existence].But the bodhisattva seeing by expanded
vision does not fall into the unconditioned and does not leave off bringing the roots
of good about.

This is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable expanded vision.

Those, reverend Śāradvatīputra, are called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable peaceful meditation
and expanded vision.
