What then is knowledge of interpretation?

Knowledge understanding the words of all beings,i. e., understanding the words of gods, the
words of snake-gods, the words of demons, the words of celestial musicians, giants, divine
birds, man-horses, great serpents, men and not men.In short, he knows all languages, sounds,
voices, ways of speech, interpretations, conventional explanations and linguistic behaviour
of living beings in the five states of existence, and having known them he teaches religion
through his understanding of words to those beings with those words and interpretations.This
is knowledge of interpretation.

Further concerning knowledge of interpretation:“These ways of practice should be seen thus,these
moments of existence [of practice] should be brought about thus,these moments of existence
should be connected with thus,these moments of existence should be understood thus,these
moments of existence should be construed with syllables thus,”thus he knows the language
of one person, knows the language of two persons, knows the language of many persons,knows
the language of men, knows the language of women, knows the language of those with no
sex,knows the language of past [beings], knows the language of future [beings], knows the
language of present [beings],knows the meaning attributed to one syllable, knows the meaning
attributed to many syllables, knows the meaning not attributed to anything.This is knowledge
of interpretation.

Further, that knowledge of interpretation is the knowledge of moments of existence designated
by language, in the cessation [or unbornness] of all moments of existence, (p. 113) this
is knowledge of interpretation.

That knowledge of interpretation of his is unhindered;not erroneous;well arranged;without repetitions;not
excessive [when it concerns sound, not harmful to the ear];not hasty;speech
not deviating from right speech [and thus clear in words and syllables (padavyañjana) ],[thus
fluent and] clear;embracing both meaning and letter;pleasing according to different congregations;having
different kinds [of explanations of one moment of existence];profound;profound
in appearance;adorned with both concealed truth and the highest meaning;penetrating
[what things are truly like] by means of one’s own thoughts, [thus penetrating one’s] knowledge
[of meaning and letters (arthavyañjana) ] and [the logical conclusions (siddhānta)
of one’s] viewpoints;taught by the Buddhas,and pleasing living beings.

This is knowledge of interpretation.
