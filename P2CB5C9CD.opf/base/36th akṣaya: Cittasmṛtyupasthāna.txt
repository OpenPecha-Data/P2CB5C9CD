36th Imperishable: The Presence of Recollection Concerned with Thought.(p. 130)

What then is the bodhisattva’s presence of recollection which consists in the consideration
of thoughtIt is not forgetting the thought of awakening, guarding it with recollection, and
no lack of concentration.

He looks at [the] thought [of awakening] this way:“Thought [that is, thought itself and the
thought of awakening] never remains once it has arisen, it is broken up and melts away as
unstable, it does not remain internally, it does not perish outwardly, it is not perceived
in between the two.The first thought of awakening arisen in me has perished and ceased, vanished
and disappeared, it is not found in any place, not in any location, it is not possible
to communicate it.And the thoughts by which the roots of good are accumulated for the
sake of awakening, these have also perished and ceased, vanished and disappeared, they are
not found in any place, not in any location, it is not possible to communicate them.The
thoughts by which roots of the good are transformed into awakening are also of that nature,
having those characteristics.Thought is not known by thought, thought is not seen by thought,
[past] thought does not [perish in the future, it does not] connect itself to [future]
thought.

What then is thought?That by which one thinks: ‘I will wake up to the incomparable perfect awakening’.But
the thought of awakening does not stay with the roots of good [since there is
really (svabhāvatas) no attainment at all]; and again, [thus] the thought of the roots of
the good does not stay with the thought of transformation.Thus he reflects.

If the bodhisattva reflecting thus does not get afraid, scared or terrified, he is one to continually
consider thought.

Again he thinks:“[Thought is essentially empty (svabhāvaśūnya), but] dependent origination is
very deep since there is no destruction of [the connection between] the cause [that which
is performed] and the fruit [attained, i. e., according to conventional truth (saṃvṛtyā)
].Even though the true state of thought is such [that it is in the highest meaning (paramārthatas)
essentially empty (svabhāvaśūnya) ], all moments of existence are dependent on causes
and conditions, but without a mover, without an activator, without an owner, beyond
appropriation.I will create them [the causes (hetu), like giving up all belongings, and the
fruit (phala), purifying my buddha-field] according to my wish, and I will exert myself
in creating [according to conventional truth (saṃvṛtyā) ], but I will not give up the true
state of thought [which is unborn according to the highest truth (paramārthatas) ].

(p. 131) What then is the true state of thought, what is creating?

Thought is like an illusion – here there is no giver at all – this is called the true state
of thought,but when one gives up all belongings and transforms it so as to purify one’s buddha-field,
it is called creating.

Thought is like a dream, characterized by absolute peace, this is called the true state of thought,but
when one transforms morality, training and qualities of purification into omniscience
– gathering the accumulation for awakening – it is called creating.

Thought is like a reflection, from the beginning not developed, this is called the true state
of thought,but when one transforms all tolerance and mildness into attaining the tolerance
that all moments of existence are unborn, it is called creating.

Thought is like a mirage [empty of water], dissociated [from and empty of subject and object
(grāhyagrāhaka) ] because of its absolute dissociation, this is called the true state of
thought,but when one transforms the undertakings of vigour for [attaining] all roots of the
good into fulfilling all teachings of the Buddha, it is called creating.

Thought is without form, it cannot be demonstrated, is unhindered [and all-pervasive (sarvatragata)
like empty space (ākāśa) ] and beyond communication, this is called the true state
of thought,but when one transforms all meditations, liberations, concentrations and the states
of concentration into attaining the concentration of a Buddha [that is, the concentration
beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpasamādhi) ], it is called creating.

Thought cannot be grasped; signless, it cannot be demonstrated, it has no basis, this is called
the true state of thought,but when one transforms the knowledge of explaining by analysis
all words of questions into fulfilling the knowledge of a Buddha, it is called creating.

Thought does not originate without an object [that is, without the causes and conditions of
objects (ālambanahetupratyaya) ], this is called the true state of thought;when one produces
thoughts that have all roots of good as the object for the sake of attaining all the qualities
of a Buddha, it is called creating.

Thought does not originate without a cause, this is called the true state of thought,but when
one produces thoughts for the sake of [that is, being the cause of] all the moments of existence
that are wings of awakening, it is called creating.

Thought does not originate without the six object-fields of sense-perception, this is called
the true state of thought,but when one produces thoughts [namely the moments of existence
of insight and expedient means (prajñopāyadharma) ] for the sake of [that is, being the cause
of, in that they produce] the field of all the teachings [and qualities] of a Buddha
[this field, however, being emptiness (śūnyatā) ], it is called creating.

The bodhisattva continually considering thought treats [and thus makes one-pointed (ekāgra)
] thought so as to attain supernormal knowledge;and having attained supernormal knowledge
by means of thought he knows the mental behaviour of all beings.Having known this he teaches
them religion in accordance with their nature.The bodhisattva continually considering thought
treats thought so as to attain great compassion; and having attained great compassion
by means of thought he never gets tired of maturing all beings.The bodhisattva continually
considering thought does not produce the thought that thought should perish, or that thought
should cease [like the disciples and isolated buddhas intent solely on peace (śānti),
on extinction (nirvāṇa); on the contrary, by expedient means (upāya) he does not cut off
the roots of good (kuśalamūla) in the stream of existence (saṃsārasrotas) ],(p. 132) but
he produces the thought to join himself to the roots of good in the stream of existence.Though
he by that knowledge of recollection of thought is situated in the moment of existence
which is the entrance into the certainty that all is unborn, does not arise and does not
cease, he does not fall into the stage of disciples and isolated buddhas.And until the fulfilment
of all qualities of a Buddha [that is, the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi)
for oneself and all other beings], he relates at any time to the continuity
of thoughts [never giving up the continuity of thoughts which is the union of insight
and expedient means (prajñôpâyayuganaddha) ];and he wakes up to incomparable, perfect awakening
by insight associated with that moment.

This is called the bodhisattvas’ presence of recollection which consists in the consideration
of thought.
