73rd Imperishable: Memory.

What then is the imperishability of memory?

It is to keep [the letters (vyañjana) ], retain [the meaning (artha) ] in mind, never again
to forget [the letters (vyañjana) ], and truly to retain [for the future the meaning (artha)
of] the eighty-four thousand aggregates of religion by means of remembrance derived from
the earlier piling up of roots of good.This is called memory.Further, memory is that by
means of which one retains [the words and meaning (arthaśabda) of] the sayings of all Buddhas,
retains the sayings of all bodhisattvas, isolated buddhas, disciples, of all beings,
that by means of which one retains all good sayings without remainder.This is called memory.Even
when he leaves for another world-age or another birth, the knowledge which consists
in the recollection of memory of that bodhisattva is not lost or forgotten [so that there
is pure remembrance, not so that one remembers some, but not all].With the eye of holy insight
he sees all moments of existence as if they were an Āmalaka fruit in the palm of his
hand.This is called imperishable memory.
