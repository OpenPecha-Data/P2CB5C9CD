6th Imperishable: Morality.

(p. 34) Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed himself to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: –
Well spoken by you, son of good family, was this imperishability of the bodhisattvas’ generosity.
May you be inspired, son of good family, on the subject of the imperishability of
the bodhisattvas’ morality, as to how the morality of the bodhisattvas becomes imperishable.

Akṣayamati said: – In sixty-five ways, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ mass of
pure morality imperishable. What are the sixty-five?

];65) morality to attain the morality of the Tathāgata through being transformed into
that morality;66) morality concerned with the concentrations and states of meditation of the
Buddhas through having the same attitude towards all beings;in these sixty-five ways, reverend
Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ mass of pure morality imperishable.

[2. The morality of the true state of things (dharmatāśīla):]Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra,
morality is where there is no attribution of a self, an animated being, a life-principle,
a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a man, no attribution of a human
being;morality is where there is no attribution of form, feeling, perception, formative factors,
no attribution of consciousness;morality is where there is no attribution of element
of earth, element of water, element of fire, no attribution of element of wind;morality
is where there is no attribution of distinguishing marks of the eye, no distinguishing marks
of form, nor of hearing or sound, nose or smell, tongue or taste, body or tangibles, no
attribution of distinguishing marks of mind, no attribution of distinguishing marks of moments
of existence;morality is where there is no attribution of body, speech or mind.

[3. Morality with the essential characteristic of the two ways (dvimārgalakṣaṇaṃ śīlam):]Morality
is that which has the essential character of peaceful meditation through one-pointedness
[having one object (ālambana) ];morality is that which has the essential character of
expanded vision through skill in discerning moments of existence [both their general and
individual characteristics (svasāmānyalakṣaṇa) ].

[4. Morality with the essential characteristic of the three gates of liberation (trivimokṣamukhalakṣaṇaṃ
śīlam):]Morality is that which is knowledge of emptiness, fully beyond distinguishing
marks, not something that can be longed for, not mingled with the threefold world.

[5. The deep morality effected through purification of the contrary to morality (śīlavipakṣaviśuddhigambhīraśīlam):]Morality
is that which is tolerance of unbornness, brought about as
not conditioned [by vices (kleśa), or by causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) ] and [from
understanding moments of existence as] unborn;morality is that which is not made, not active;morality
is that which is not born in the beginning, does not perish in the end, does
not remain in between;morality is that which is pure thought, not dependent on consciousness,
not mingled with mental effort;morality is that which is not dependent on the world of
desire [not depending on the the qualities, viz. the objects of desire (kāmaguṇa) ], not
remaining in the world of forms [tasting the pleasure of meditation (dhyānāsvāda) ], not
staying in the formless world [not being born there though having attained the formless states
of meditation (ārūpyasamāpatti) ];morality is that which is to give up the impurities
of passion, which is avoiding malice, harshness, aversion and repugnance, and which is the
absence of delusions, darkness and ignorance;morality is that which is neither [belief in]
permanence, nor nihilism, it is not in disaccord with the principle of dependent origination;morality
is that which is without the principle of an ego, without things related to
the ego, not abiding by the view that there is a permanent substance;morality is that which
is no attachment to names [that is, informative concepts (prajñāpti) like Devadatta or
Yajñadatta] and signs [like “Devadatta has qualities (guṇavān)”], not abiding by distinguishing
marks of form [like “form gives resistance (sapratigha)”] , no mingling with names and
forms [that is, the parts of personality (skandha) ];morality is that which is absence
of causal bad dispositions, non-arising of doctrinal view-points, (p. 37) not abiding by hindrances
like regret;morality is that which does not abide by the root of bad which is covetousness,
does not abide by the root of bad which is aversion, does not abide by the root
of bad which is delusion;morality is that which is indefatigable, without desires and thus
having the essential character of tranquility;morality is that which is the non-interruption
of the Buddhas’ lineage because of [attaining] the transcendent body, non-interruption
of the lineage of religious teaching because of [attaining] non-separation from total reality,
non-interruption of the lineage of the religious community because the unconditioned
is revealed.

Morality, reverend Śāradvatīputra, should be seen as imperishable because of the imperishability
of its continuity.

Why? The morality of ordinary people perishes because of the places they are born;the morality
of those possessing the five outer supernormal powers [like the seers (ṛṣi) ] perishes
when they are deprived of their supernormal powers;the morality of men perishes when the ten
ways of good action perish;the morality of the sons of gods in the world of desire perishes
when their merit perishes;the morality of the sons of gods in the world of form perishes
when their immeasurable states and meditations perish;the morality of the sons of gods
in the formless world perishes when their meditation-produced births perish;the morality
of disciples – those still to be trained and those needing no more training – perishes in
the end by extinction;the morality of isolated buddhas perishes because of their lack of great
compassion.But the morality of the bodhisattvas, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is imperishable.Why?
Because all types of morality originate from that morality [which here is to be
taken in the same meaning as the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), the essence (svabhāva)
of that morality].Just as, reverend Śāradvatīputra, when the seed is imperishable, the gain
is also imperishable, thus, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the morality of the Tathāgatas should
be known as imperishable since its seed, the thought of awakening, is imperishable.And
that is why these good men are called “those whose morality is imperishable”.

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is called the bodhisattvas’ imperishable morality.
