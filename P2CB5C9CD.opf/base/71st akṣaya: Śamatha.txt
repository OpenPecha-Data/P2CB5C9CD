71st Imperishable: Peaceful Meditation.

What then is the imperishability of peaceful meditation?

[Accumulations for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra): 1. The secondary accumulation (aprādhānyasaṃbhāra):][Inner]
peace, [outer] calm and [inner and outer] tranquillity of thought
[with no sloth and torpor (styānamiddha) ];[since it is peace, as there is not much inner
thought-construction (vikalpa) ] no disturbance and [since it is calm as there are no thought-constructions
of outer things] control of the senses;[since it is free of thought-constructions
of both inner and outer things] neither haughtiness nor pride;no noisy speech
[like that of kings and thieves];no unsteadiness [since it is not in the power of vices (klesavaśa)
];no wavering [as it cannot be disturbed by the adversaries of concentration (samādhivipakṣa)
];mildness [yielding to others],guarding oneself [since one vows not to enter
the objects of the eyes and the other senses (cakṣurādîndriyaviṣaya) ],being well trained
[or docility],fitness [being free of sloth and torpor (styānamiddha) ],one-pointedness,being
content with being alone,avoiding crowds,happiness at being detached [feeling joy in
one-pointed thought (cittaikāgrya) ],being detached in body [content with being alone and
avoiding crowds],no fluctuation of thought,being mentally turned towards the wilderness [in
the mountains and in caves (giriśailaguhā) ],having few wishes [for clothing (cīvara) and
almsbowls (piṇḍapāta) ],not desiring [other things],not desiring much,contentment,purity
of livelihood,perfection in behaviour,guarding one’s deportment,knowing the right time,knowing
the proper moment,knowing the improper situation,knowledge of the proper quantity,moderation
in eating,being easily fed,through careful consideration not being elated or depressed
[when praised and reproached],enduring offensive and insulting ways of speech.

[The primary accumulation (prādhānyasaṃbhāra):]Producing thoughts bent on religious practice
[that is producing thoughts for cultivating peaceful meditation and expanded vision (śamathavipaśyanābhāvanācittotpāda):]taking
pleasure in retiring for meditation,mental effort with
the limbs of meditation as the object,producing friendliness,and engendering compassion,[the
two being roots of concentration (samādhi) ], establishing [one’s thoughts] in joy,[producing
undisturbed concentration (akopyasamādhi), and thus] cultivating equanimity.

[Peaceful meditation itself is:]The first [state of] meditation, the second meditation, the
third meditation, the fourth meditation, the field of [meditation where the] infinity of space
[is experienced], the field of infinity of consciousness, the field of not anything in
particular, the field of neither concept nor no concept, the cessation of concept and feeling,
(p. 147) these nine successive states of meditation are called peaceful meditation.

Thus the accumulations for peaceful meditation are immeasurable [as the moments of existence
which are causes of cultivating peaceful meditation (śamathabhāvanāhetu) are immeasurable
like space (yathākāśa) ], and thus exertion in those accumulations of peaceful meditation
is called imperishable peaceful meditation [since it produces immeasurable (apramāṇa) peaceful
meditation].
