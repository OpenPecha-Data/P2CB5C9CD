X. Knowledge of the Means to That

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ four reliances are also imperishable. What
four? 1) Reliance on meaning, not reliance on the letter; 2) reliance on knowledge, not
reliance on consciousness; 3) reliance on explicit scriptures, not reliance on implicit scriptures;
4) reliance on the true state of moments of existence, not reliance on the person.
