(p. 90) 13th Imperishable: Joy.

Further, reverend Śāradvatīputra, the great joy of the bodhisattvas is also imperishable.What
then is great joy?

It is gladness, harmony and delight resulting from remembrance and recollection of the qualities
of a Buddha;absence of dejection and depression in thought;absence of thirst for pleasure;doing
away with all delight in pleasure,it is the basis of all delight in religion;delight
in thought, excitement in body, fascination of the intellect and happiness of mind;the
joy and delight caused by the body of the Tathāgata and skill in searching for his ornaments
consisting in the primary characteristics and the secondary marks of beauty;absence
of fatigue when listening to the good religion;gladness, harmony and delight in the accomplishment
of confidence in the essential moments of existence,the happiness of the one thus
delighted with regard to these moments of existence;always to have a mind free from aversion
towards living beings,and intense desire in searching for the qualities of the Buddha,
not laying aside that desire;reliance on, and freedom in the great religion of the Buddha
and producing thoughts drawn away from limited religious ways;producing thoughts not narrowed
down by meanness;the desire to give to those who ask, the giver’s triply purified delight
in giving after having given;always feeling harmony with moral people, but being pleased
to help the immoral, by one’s own purity of morality giving the consolation that the fear
of any bad destiny can be transcended;transforming [one’s own morality by purifying it]
into the morality of the Tathāgata;firmness [so as not to come into the power of bad moments
of existence] and unbreakableness;thoughts which are not hostile, tolerance and gentleness
towards others whose ways of speech are wicked and bad;absence of conceit;respect consisting
in bowing to and revering teachers;always a smiling face and no sternness;readiness
to speak;absence of hypocrisy, boasting or threatening;pure intention, no harshness in
thought and no fraudulence;seeing what is praiseworthy in everything and reflecting on one’s
own faults;not encouraging sin, but pursuing the delightful moments of existence;love for
the bodhisattvas like love for the teacher [the Lord Buddha];love for religion like love
for oneself;love for the Tathāgatas like love for one’s life;love for one’s masters like
love for one’s father and mother;(p. 91) love for livings beings like love for one’s sons;love
for one’s teachers and preceptors like love for the Buddha;love for spiritual progress
like love for one’s head;love for the perfections like love for one’s hands and feet;love
for preachers of religion like love for all kinds of riches;love for all the qualities
of a Buddha like love for the jewel which grants all wishes;love for admonitions like love
for all joy and pleasure;love for contentment like love for health;love for seeking religion
like love for medicines;love for those who urge one on and make one mindful like love
for a physician.

[To summarize:] Reverend Śāradvatīputra, this resilience of the faculties in all one’s faculties
is said to be great joy.

Great joy has the form [or essence (svabhāva) ] of peace since it is the knowledge of understanding;the
form of absolute peace since it is the absence of haughtiness;the form of tranquility
since it is the absence of arrogance [which is not to have given up the vices (kleśa)
];the form of joy of the senses since it is not distracted [because of concentration (samādhi)
];the form of ascetic commitment since it is the absence of forgetfulness;the form
of gentleness since it is wished for [by all, being pleasant];the form of listening since
it is gentleness in speech;the form of calmness since it is fitness of thought;the form
of contentment since it is action well done;the form of no regret since it is faultless [having
done no sin];the form of being well established since it is immovable [by hostile forces,
etc. (vipakṣâdi) ];the form of being immovable since it is not established in any particular
place [among things (bhāva) and distinguishing marks (nimitta) ];the form of being
hard to conquer since it is hard to subdue;the form of real meaning since it is never lost;the
form of truth since it is never different from what it is;the form of reality since
it effects just that;the form of effort since it is power;the form of power since it is uncrushable;the
form of fulfilling the qualities of the Buddha through not getting tired of
seeking the qualities of the Buddha in the right way.

This, reverend Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattvas’ imperishable great joy.
