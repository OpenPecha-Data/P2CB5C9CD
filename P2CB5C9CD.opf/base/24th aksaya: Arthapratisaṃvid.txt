24th Imperishable: Knowledge of The Meaning.

What then is knowledge of the meaning [or the individual essential characteristics (pṛthaglakṣaṇa)
]?

Knowledge of the real meaning in all moments of existence,i. e., knowledge of the moments of
existence [knowledge that the conditioned (saṃskṛta) things in the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu)
have the essential characteristic (lakṣaṇa) and nature (dharmatā) of suffering (duḥkha)
and impermanence (anityatā) ];reflective knowledge [knowing the essential characteristic
of the causes (hetu) and conditions (pratyaya) in the origin (hetusamudaya) from which
the suffering in the same sphere (dhātu) stems];successive knowledge [namely that of the
above-mentioned characteristics in the spheres of form (rūpadhātu) and no form (ārūpyadhātu)
also];knowledge of [the meaning and essential characteristics of the six kinds of] causes;knowledge
of conditions;knowledge of the combinations [of causes and conditions as they
bring about fruit];knowledge of non-duality [of no extremes like eternity or cessation (śāśvatoccheda),
or, that causes and conditions are non-existent in the highest meaning (paramârthatas)
];knowledge of not going to any extreme;knowledge of not remaining in the middle;[but
still] knowledge of understanding the conditions [involved in dependent origination
(pratītyasamutpāda) ];knowledge of the homogeneity of the sphere of all moments of existence;knowledge
in accordance with things as they are [namely in accordance with universal
emptiness (śūnyatā) ];knowledge of being on [the noble way (āryamārga) to] the limit of existence
[which is emptiness (śūnyatā) ];knowledge of understanding emptiness;knowledge of
behaviour with no distinguishing marks;knowledge of not longing for anything, there being
nothing to long for;knowledge of the absence of conditioning when confronted with the unconditioned;knowledge
of penetrating the one principle [or the one essential characteristic
(ekalakṣaṇa) of all moments of existence];knowledge understanding selflessness,knowledge
understanding no being,knowledge understanding no life-principle,knowledge of the highest
truth of no personality;knowledge not attached to the past;knowledge of the future as unsettled
[having no end, being imperishable (akṣaya), or, unhindered knowledge of future events];knowledge
of the present as wholly unblamable [since no aversion or attraction arises
understanding the present things as without essence (niḥsvabhāva) ];knowledge of illusion
when concerned with the parts of personality [as created by a magician (māyākāra) ];knowledge
seeing the spheres of sense-perception as snake-poison [killing fast the roots of good
(kuśalamūla) ];knowledge of introspection concerned with the fields of sense-perception as
empty villages [without any beings (sattva), like the fields of sense-perception are without
self or anything realated to a self (ātmātmīya) ];knowledge of inner peace;knowledge
of no activity concerned with outer things;knowledge of the objects of perception as non-different
from an illusion;knowledge of practising recollection;knowledge in accordance with
tolerance [of both pain (duḥkhādhivāsanākṣānti) and the unborn state of things (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)
];knowledge reflecting with intelligence [the essence of insight (prajñāsvabhāva)
];knowledge of seeing [the essence (svabhāva) of] the self;knowledge of seeing when
it concerns the truths;knowledge of non-origination when it concerns suffering;knowledge
of the unconditioned when it concerns the origin [of suffering];knowledge of no distinguishing
marks when it concerns cessation [of suffering];knowledge of liberating [from the ocean
of existence (saṃsārasamudra) ] when it concerns the way [to cessation of suffering];knowledge
of the divisions of words concerning the moments of existence [knowing how to explain
their meaning (artha) ];knowledge of no recollection and no mental effort when it concerns
the practice of recollection;knowledge understanding both the good and the bad [so
as to increase the good and get rid of the bad] when it concerns correct exertions;knowledge
of the swiftness of body and mind when concerned with the bases of magic [making body and
thought useful (kāyacittakarmaṇyatā) ];knowledge attaining the abilities;knowledge of the
uncrushable when concerned with the powers;knowledge seeing all moments of existence as
they are when concerned with the limbs of awakening;knowledge of no going and no coming when
concerned with the way;knowledge of remaining when concerned with peaceful meditation;knowledge
of manifestation when concerned with expanded vision;knowledge of [deceptive] creations
[of, e.g., elephants and men created by means of incantations (mantra) or drugs (auṣadha)
] when confronted with illusions;the knowledge of misunderstanding [air for water]
when confronted with a mirage;knowledge of seeing irreality [of the moments of existence
appearing] in a dream;knowledge of apprehending the condition [namely that it arises from
another sound] for the echo;knowledge of the unchanging [on which the images are projected]
when concerned with images;knowledge [as explained in the section on truth] of the one characteristic
in what has different characteristics;knowledge of disintegration in combinations
[that all composite things in the end disintegrate];knowledge of no connection [from
the moments of existence in one birth to those in another birth, when viewed from the standpoint
of the highest meaning (paramārtha) ] in connections;knowledge of understanding in
accordance with the words of others [of teachers and preceptors (ācārôpādhyāya) ] when concerned
with the way of disciples;knowledge understanding dependence [of phenomena on each
other], knowledge of staying apart [in body] and one-pointedness [of thought] when concerned
with the way of the isolated buddhas;(p. 110) knowledge of begetting accumulations of
the roots of good when concerned with the great way.This is knowledge of the meaning.

Further about knowledge of the meaning: knowledge of the meaning is that by which one relies
on all moments of existence through reliance on the meaning.Why?

All moments of existence are absolutely empty, and the meaning which is emptiness is the meaning
concerned;all moments of existence are completely without distinguishing marks, and the
meaning which is being without distinguishing marks is the meaning concerned;all moments
of existence are completely beyond longing, and the meaning which is being beyond longing
is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unconditioned, and the
meaning which is being unconditioned is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are
completely beyond origination [in the future], and the meaning which is complete non-origination
is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence are completely unborn [in the past],
and the meaning which is complete unbornness is the meaning concerned;all moments of
existence are completely inexistent [having no own nature (svabhāva) in the present], and
the meaning which is complete inexistence is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence
are completely separate [since essentially being what they are (tathatāsvabhāvatvāt) ],
and the meaning which is complete separatedness is the meaning concerned;all moments of existence
are completely without self, being, life-principle, personality, and the meaning which
is no self, being, life-principle or personality is the meaning concerned.

Understanding moments of existence this way is knowledge of the meaning.

[To summarize:] The teaching concerning this is an unhindered teaching, unattached teaching,
imperishable teaching, a teaching of attaining all moments of existence; that teaching of
meaning is knowledge of the meaning.That knowledge of the meaning is imperishable in displaying
all meaning,even the Lord Buddhas teach it and are pleased [when others teach it].[That
is because] it is true, essentially no lie and no other than itself,it is the wholly
unblamable understanding through insight and knowledge.

This is knowledge of the meaning.
