5th Imperishable: Generosity.

Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra spoke these words to the bodhisattva Akṣayamati: – Is there,
son of good family, any other imperishability of the bodhisattvas?

Akṣayamati said: – There is, reverend Śāradvatīputra. The generosity of the bodhisattvas is
also imperishable. Why? It is immeasurable. Reverend Śāradvatīputra, the bodhisattvas’ enjoyment
of generosity is immeasurable.

reverend Śāradvatīputra, there is no gift of the bodhisattvas for the sake of

the wish of being born as the king of the gods, the highest god, a protector of the world
or in the group of all the gods;no gift which is transformed into the way of disciples or
isolated buddhas;no gift wishing to be a crown-prince and to have the power of a king;no
gift [of] which [the result] disappears in one lifetime;no gift [thinking:] “It is enough
[with one lifetime], further giving is not needed”;no gift not transformed into the thought
of omniscience;no unsuitable gift [as when giving too much food and drink to ascetics,
and giving garlic, onion, meat and wine to those who do not eat these things as they think
it is not right (pratikūla), thus defiling them];no gift at the wrong time [as when giving
to others without first giving to one’s own retinue];no gift of poison [even wine] or swords;no
gift [of meat, blood, etc.] that involves the injury of living beings [like the killing
of sheep, etc.].[In short], the generosity of the bodhisattvas is not censured by the
wise.

[3. Its pure nature (viśuddhasvabhāva) as the adoption of an antidote (pratipakṣaparigraha):][a)
